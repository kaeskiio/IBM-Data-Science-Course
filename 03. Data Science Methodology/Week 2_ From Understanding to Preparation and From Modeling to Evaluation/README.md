# From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
> In this module, you will learn what data scientists do when their tasks and goals are to understand, prepare, and clean the data. You’ll examine the purposes, characteristics, and goals of the data modeling process. You’ll also explore how to prepare a data set by handling missing, invalid, or misleading data. Then check out the hands-on labs where you can gain experience completing tasks relevant to the Data Understanding, Data Preparation, and Modeling and Evaluation stages. You’ll be able to apply the skills you learn to future data science problems.
# Learning Objectives
