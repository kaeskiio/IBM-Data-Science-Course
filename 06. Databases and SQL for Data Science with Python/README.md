# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
Course 6 of 12 in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
## About This Course
> "Working knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a must for data professionals like Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Data Engineers. Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL is a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases.<Br><Br>
> In this course you will learn SQL inside out- from the very basics of Select statements to
advanced concepts like JOINs.<br><br>
> You will:
> - write foundational SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
> - filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses
> - differentiate between DML & DDL
> - CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables
> - use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions
> - build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables
> - access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python
> - work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs through hands-on labs and projects<br><Br>
> You will practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the Cloud, and use real data science tools.<br><Br>
> In the final project youâ€™ll analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate your skills."
