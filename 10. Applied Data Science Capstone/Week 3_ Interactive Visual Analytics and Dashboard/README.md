# Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
> In this module, you will build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. You will then build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
# Learning Objectives
- Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash Python library.
- Calculate distances on an interactive map by writing Python code using the Folium library.
- Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using the Folium library.
- Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
- Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
